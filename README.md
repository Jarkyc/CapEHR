# CapEHR

Prototype for BMAH High school Senior Year Capstone. Premise was a program that doctors could use to navigate medical records using voice commands.
The client program would run on personal devices, take in a voice file, and then use Google's Speech to Text API to turn it into a string, that
would then be sent to the server program running somewhere locally. The server would then interpret the string and send back another string.
